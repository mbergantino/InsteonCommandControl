Purpose

Deploy Insteon Command Control on a Raspberry Pi or spare computer to control your lights, thermostat, fireplace, shades, fans, etc from the other room, your neighbor's house, work, or away on vacation - from any internet connected device, anytime anywhere. 

Use IFTTT to automatically turn on the lights when you arrive home or turn out the lights without having to get out of bed. Control your smart home devices using Siri/Ok Google (by sending having your phone send a text to your IFTTT phone number, stored as a contact, which forwards the message to your email account).


Setup

In addition to the obvious, (configuring your email address, email server, email password, credentials for your Insteon hub, Insteon device IDs) you should treat the rooms and devices contained within the file as examples. Though fully functional as is, you may have a library but no sun room, a fireplace but no overhead fan, a fan in every room, or no light fixtures*. Please use the main file as a guide, but configure the number of rooms, room names, devices within those rooms.

*I haven't tried autonomously lighting candles, so no warranty is offered. In fact, no warranty is offered at all, so use at your own risk. That said, logging is included.
